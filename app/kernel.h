/* Runtime kernel resolution. Instead of trusting a per-firmware offset table, the
 * service locates the kernel routines it needs by their own code signatures at
 * startup and derives what it can from the matched code. Nothing here gates on a
 * firmware version: whatever resolves is used, whatever does not resolve turns its
 * feature off. Worst case on an unknown kernel is a feature that stays dark, never
 * a wrong write. The matcher is app/sigscan.h; the signatures are app/kernel_sigs.h.
 *
 * Public API (the resolver shell and the three service entry points live in
 * app/bt_patch.c; everything in THIS header is pure and host-testable):
 *
 *   int bta_kernel_init(void);
 *       Resolve once in ring 0 and cache the result in a userland global. Returns 0
 *       when the kernel base was recovered (and the result copied out), nonzero
 *       otherwise. Idempotent: later calls return the cached verdict. The three
 *       feature entry points (bta_apply_patch / bt_list / bt_prepare) call it
 *       themselves, so callers need not sequence it.
 *   unsigned bta_kernel_caps(void);        BTA_KCAP_* bitmask of what resolved.
 *   const struct bta_kernel *bta_kernel_info(void);   the cached resolution.
 *   unsigned bta_kernel_report(char *out, unsigned cap);
 *       One human-readable line describing the resolution (for a bug report);
 *       returns its length. Formatting is bta_kernel_format() below.
 *
 * What resolves generically (any firmware) vs. from the known-firmware table:
 *   - The six routine addresses and the cache bounds are found/derived from live
 *     code, so they resolve on any kernel whose code still matches the signatures.
 *   - ctx_ptr, fmt_string and the record-layout offsets cannot be found by pattern
 *     (a data pointer in a zeroed region; a string run; struct field offsets), so
 *     they come from a small table applied ONLY when the firmware is 13.520.001.
 *     On any other firmware they stay zero and the device-list / widen features
 *     stay off; the accept patch, which needs none of them, still works. */

 * the patch_site pattern opens with the bytes the patch overwrites, so once the

 * than the console reboots (the app relaunches it, deploy_variant.py stops and
