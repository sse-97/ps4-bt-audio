 * when the next automatic attempt is due, how long to back off, whether to give
 * up, which SBC mode to try next, and whether the console just woke from rest
 * mode. None of these touch the driver, so all of them are tested on the host.

 *                next attempt (also the resting point between attempts)
 *   DISCOVERING  scanning because the target is not in the driver's cache yet
 *   CONNECTING   link requested, waiting for the driver to report it up
 *   PAIRING      the device asked for a PIN; waiting for the user to supply it
 *   CONFIGURING  link up, three-slot packet types requested, settling
