/* Clock-paced audio sending with a bounded capture-ring backlog.
 *
 * The 2.7.5 sender sent a packet whenever at least one was waiting and only
 * resynchronised once ~128 ms had piled up, so a scheduling hiccup could leave
 * that much stale audio in flight and the console's own buffer grew to match.
 * This module decides, from the wall clock and the bytes waiting in the capture
 * ring, whether to send now, and how many of the oldest bytes to drop first:
 *
 *   - At the start of playback (and after an underrun) it prebuffers: it holds
 *     off sending until the backlog has built up to the target. That cushion is
 *     the jitter buffer; without it any scheduling jitter would starve the sink.
 *   - Then one packet per interval (clock pacing). The driver is fed at the
 *     playout rate, so the console-side buffer is fed no faster than it drains
 *     and cannot grow, and the cushion is held at the target.
 *   - A backlog above target + one packet is trimmed by dropping the oldest
 *     bytes, so it stays shallow continuously instead of in one 128 ms jump.
 *   - A hard ceiling, well under the ring, catches a long stall: the excess is
 *     dropped at once and the clock realigns.
 *
 * Pure integer logic with no clock, ring layout or float, so a host test drives
 * it with a fake clock and a simulated backlog (tests/test_pacing.c). The worker
 * supplies `now` and `available` and applies `skip` with bta_ring_advance. */
